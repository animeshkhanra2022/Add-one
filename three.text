Hi, this is the new file called three 

This is a fast-forward merge. It means that the commits in the bug-fix branch are directly merged into the main branch. This can be useful when you want to merge a branch that has already been pushed to the remote repository.
The difference is resolving the conflicts. In a fast-forward merge, there are no conflicts. But in a not fast-forward merge, there are conflicts, and there are no shortcuts to resolve them. You have to manually resolve the conflicts. Decide, what to keep and what to discard. VSCode has a built-in merge tool that can help you resolve the conflicts.

In this section, we have learned about the different types of merges and how to resolve conflicts. We have also learned about the importance of branching and merging in Git and Github. By the end of this section, you should have a good understanding of how to use Git and Github effectively.
